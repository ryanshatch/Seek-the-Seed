  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The Random Number Guessing Game is a Python program that allows players to guess a random number generated within a
    specified range. It is a simple and entertaining way to test your guessing skills and luck.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Run the program.</li>
    <li>Enter a seed value for the random number generator. This seed will ensure the same sequence of random numbers for
      testing purposes.</li>
    <li>Enter the lower bound for the random number range.</li>
    <li>Enter the upper bound for the random number range. The lower bound must be less than the upper bound.</li>
    <li>The program will generate a random number between the specified lower and upper bounds (for testing purposes only).
    </li>
    <li>The program will prompt you to guess a number between the lower and upper bounds.</li>
    <li>If your guess is lower than the generated number, the program will display "Nope, too low."</li>
    <li>If your guess is higher than the generated number, the program will display "Nope, too high."</li>
    <li>If your guess is the same as the generated number, the program will display "You got it!"</li>
    <li>Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="example-of-gameplay">Example of Gameplay</h2>

  <p>
    Assume you want to test the game with the following values:<br>
    <code>Seed Value: 3<br>
    Lower Bound: 1<br>
    Upper Bound: 5</code>
  </p>
  
  <code><ol>
    <li>Run the program.</li>
    <li>Enter the seed value: 3</li>
    <li>Enter the lower bound: 1</li>
    <li>Enter the upper bound: 5</li>
    <li>The program generates a random number between 1 and 5 (for testing purposes only).</li>
    <li>The program prompts, "What is your guess?" You enter your guess.</li>
    <li>The program provides feedback based on your guess.</li>
    <li>Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number. The program will display "You got it!" when you guess the correct number.</li></code>
  </ol>
